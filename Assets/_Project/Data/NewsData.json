The community centre committee had hoped to hold three sessions a week for the next year to allow people “to come together to sit, chat and socialise for a few hours where they don’t have to heat or use electricity at home”. However, their plans suffered a blow when a bid for nearly £10,000 from the National Lottery was turned down.They are now proposing to hold two sessions a week over 26 weeks to reduce running costs.The project had been awarded £7, 000 by Kirkcudbright’s common good fund - but that was conditional on other bids being successful.The lottery rejection has resulted in a new application being made, which will be presented to the common good fund’s sub committee next week.The bid states: “We are confident that further funding will be awarded and that the project will be extended another six months at the very least. “If we are able to start now, rather than wait to hear from other funders, it would capitalise on the momentum from the community for the project. “It would also cover the much needed Easter and summer holidays, a time when many families struggle with basic living costs due to lack of school meals.” They have contributed £1, 500 of their own funds and received £1, 000 from Stewartry area committee, with Kirkcudbright Rotary expected to donate £500.","__v":0}]}
